            <h2>A Brief History</h2>
            <p>I am attending the University of Miami to learn more about computers and how the business world works. My primary goals are learning to communicate effectively with customers, other businesses, and learning how to create computer programs. I enjoy teaching my family, friends, and peers how to use their computers, optimizing them for their lifestyles and even assembling them from the ground up. If I spot a problem, I can’t help but do my best to solve it or leave it better than it was. I'm a troubleshooter, a fixer-upper, and ready to work with and help out others.</p>

            <dl>
            <dt>University of Miami (January 2013 - Present)</dt>
            <dd>After studying for a major in electronic media for the first few years, I ultimately decided I wanted to delve into the electronic side of things, so I am currently studying computer science and I’ve never been happier with that choice.</dd>
            <dt>Saint John's University (August 2012 - December 2012)</dt>
            <dd>I studied at Saint John’s in New York to familiarize myself with a fast-paced environment, but after being accepted into the University of Miami for the Spring, I knew that it was the better school, and it was closer to home.</dd>
